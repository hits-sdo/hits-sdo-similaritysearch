# 5/24 Notes

#### Path workspace: `/content/hits-sdo-similaritysearch`
#### Mob Timer: [here](https://mobti.me/sunbird)

### Goals
- Split dataset into training, validation and test set
- Tune the model's hyperparameters on validation set
- Optimize compactness of clusters

### What we did today
- To Split dataset into training, validation and test set to tune the model's hyperparameters on validation set, we:
    - Before the collate_fn cell, we imported `from sdo_augmentation.augmentation import Augmentations`. To test if augmentations imported correctly.
    - Then we tested that by changing the paths and image index. Changing the sys path append to source `hits-sdo-similaritysearch/`
        + Hard wrote the `file_dir` in the interest of time. But we shall change to using `for root,dir,files in os.walk(path):` later.
    - We sourced some example files:
        + `20100601_000036_aia.lev1_euv_12s_4k_tile_384_3584.jpg`
        + `20100601_000036_aia.lev1_euv_12s_4k_tile_2176_1920.jpg`
        + `20100601_000036_aia.lev1_euv_12s_4k_tile_2688_768.jpg`
    - Split and grab the data instrument, tile's info and file type. Mainly to save the i & j start index of the image.
    - Reconstucted tile info/name and how we are doing the superImage return (`stitch_adj_img()` in `image_utils.py`)
        + Documentation for `image_utils.py` following Google's style guide (suggestion from Cam)
        + Link [here](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
    - Added `.jpg` compatibility

### Next step
- Custom collate function
- Continue with tuning the hyperparameters
